# smokingisbad4u

This is the README file for project smokingisbad4u

This is intended only for beginners practicing the usage of GitHub. May contain traces of anti-smoking songs.

I recommend you start by adding new files or editing existing ones. Adventurous souls may consider uploading vids of themselves singing the lyrics :)
