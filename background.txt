BACKGROUND


I first started singing in 2005. I had finished my Ph. D. and waiting for my supervisor to go through it.
I bought a guitar and sang in the mall. Everything ran smoothly until my parents found out.

Since then I have moved onto other stuff such as songs about late trains, Crossy Road, a work-related
rap song to Million Voices (by Otto Knows) and a Karaoke version of Darude's Sandstorm, and even a stand-up
comedy skit about Glimmer Train (correctly) rejecting a short story that I had no business submitting in the first place.
